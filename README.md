# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
The project refactors the module 2 solution code by using functions such as For, IF, Array, and Loop. The codes efficiently run through all stocks to calculate the trading volume and return by ticker. It also is uswer friendly by having input message box and runtime message to help the user understand what was done with how much time. 

## Results

#### Stock Performance Comparison Between 2017 and 2018

The two tables below show the outcome of the analysis:

![](https://github.com/lu-chang-axonic/stock-analysis/blob/main/2018%20Result%20for%20Stock%20Analysis.png)

The color coded result made it easy to identify 2017 being a better year of the stocks under discussion. 

#### Execution Time Comparison
The two message boxes below how the run time of the analysis was before the refactoring:

![](https://github.com/lu-chang-axonic/stock-analysis/blob/main/images/Original%20Run%20Time%202018.PNG)

The two message boxes below how the run time of the analysis was after the refactoring:
![](https://github.com/lu-chang-axonic/stock-analysis/blob/main/2017%20Result%20for%20Stock%20Analysis.png)
![](https://github.com/lu-chang-axonic/stock-analysis/blob/main/2018%20Result%20for%20Stock%20Analysis.png)

So, clearly the performance of the code was improved, as reflected by the reduced execution time.
